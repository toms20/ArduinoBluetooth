ArduinoBluetooth
================

A simple Android App that interacts with an Arduino via Bluetooth Sockets

This is based heavily off of Android's Bluetooth Chat sample code!

It utilizes the AndroidBluetooth Arduino Library found @ https://github.com/toms20/AndroidBluetooth.git

This code has not been debugged and has known issues...
  - Force closing during onStart can be fixed by turning OFF bluetooth and launching the app
