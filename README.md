ArduinoBluetooth
================

A simple Android App that interacts with an Arduino via Bluetooth Sockets

This is based heavily off of Android's Bluetooth Chat sample code!

It utilizes the AndroidBluetooth Arduino Library found here

This code has not been debugged and has known issues...
  - Force closing during onStart can be fixed by turning OFF bluetooth and launching the app
